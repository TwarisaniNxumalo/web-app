**Updated Problem Statement, Proposed Solution & Use Case**

**Problem Statement:**

Lift Search app faces the challenge of users bypassing the platform to pay each

other directly, leading to potential conflicts between drivers and passengers.

Additionally, the accuracy of matching pickups and drop-offs needs improvement

to enhance user satisfaction.

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Subscription-Based Model:**

To discourage direct payments and foster trust within the carpooling

community, we will introduce subscription plans for passengers. These plans

will offer incentives and value-added services, such as priority matching and

discounts, encouraging users to transact through the app. The platform will

ensure transparent and conflict-free transactions while generating revenue to

sustain operations and enhance user experience.

**Enhanced Matching Algorithm:**

To improve the accuracy of matching pickups and drop-offs, we will implement

a radius check feature in our app. Utilizing the Haversine Formula for

calculating the distance between two points on a sphere (like the Earth) given

their longitude and latitude, we will calculate the straight-line distance

between the driver's current location and the passenger's destination.

Additionally, Google Maps offers a Distance Matrix API that calculates travel

distance and time between multiple origins and destinations, including various

travel modes (driving, walking, cycling, etc.). We will use this API to calculate

the driving distance between the driver's route and the passenger's

destination, factoring in real-time traffic. By calculating distances between

passenger destinations and driver routes, incorporating user-defined radius

parameters, and considering factors like traffic conditions, our algorithm will

optimize matching efficiency, ensuring that passengers' destinations fall within

a specified distance from the driver's route, thereby enhancing user

satisfaction and the overall effectiveness of the app**.**
