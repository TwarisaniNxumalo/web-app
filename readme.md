**Updated Problem Statement, Proposed Solution & Use Case**

**Problem Statement:**

Lift Search app faces the challenge of users bypassing the platform to pay each

other directly, leading to potential conflicts between drivers and passengers.

Additionally, the accuracy of matching pickups and drop-offs needs improvement

to enhance user satisfaction.

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Subscription-Based Model:**

To discourage direct payments and foster trust within the carpooling

community, we will introduce subscription plans for passengers. These plans

will offer incentives and value-added services, such as priority matching and

discounts, encouraging users to transact through the app. The platform will

ensure transparent and conflict-free transactions while generating revenue to

sustain operations and enhance user experience.

**Enhanced Matching Algorithm:**

To improve the accuracy of matching pickups and drop-offs, we will implement

a radius check feature in our app. Utilizing the Haversine Formula for

calculating the distance between two points on a sphere (like the Earth) given

their longitude and latitude, we will calculate the straight-line distance

between the driver's current location and the passenger's destination.

Additionally, Google Maps offers a Distance Matrix API that calculates travel

distance and time between multiple origins and destinations, including various

travel modes (driving, walking, cycling, etc.). We will use this API to calculate

the driving distance between the driver's route and the passenger's

destination, factoring in real-time traffic. By calculating distances between

passenger destinations and driver routes, incorporating user-defined radius

parameters, and considering factors like traffic conditions, our algorithm will

optimize matching efficiency, ensuring that passengers' destinations fall within

a specified distance from the driver's route, thereby enhancing user

satisfaction and the overall effectiveness of the app**.**

  - Yingisani Honest Shivambu
  - Tylon Takaidza
  - Rishongile Tshabalala

<ins># Updated Problem Statement, Proposed Solution & Use Cases</ins>

<ins>### Problem Statement:</ins>

LiftSearch is currently struggling with inconsistent usage leading to lost revenue,as once users are used to each other they often arrange rides directly, bypassing the platform, Additionally, the accuracy of matching pickups and drop-offs is sometimes inaccurate. These issues, coupled with LiftSearch only dealing in long-distance rides (usually cross-province), reduces overall engagement; whereas South Africa is having a growing demand for affordable, reliable transportation for short regular trips.

<ins>### Proposed Solutions:</ins>

To address these challenges, we will implement the following solutions:

<ins>### Short Regular Rides:

Implement a new feature that supports short, routine travel options, such as minibus taxis for school learners and worker transportation, increasing usage frequency. Unlike existing services like Uber, Bolt, and other carpooling options which primarily cater to on-demand individual rides, the proposed solution introduces structured, routine travel options, catering to a niche market with consistent needs, rather than purely on-demand services.

The system will be implemented as follows:

**Driver Route Posting:** Allow drivers to post their starting point, destination and time. They can mention their workplace/any specific destination such as a mall etc, or just the city name if they are open to picking up anyone within the city. 

**Rider Matching:** Match riders with drivers based on distance. Prioritize the nearest drivers. If an exact match isn't found, match passengers with drivers heading in the same direction, provided the passenger is within a specified radius of the driver's route.

**Driver Availability Management:** Enable drivers to post their availability. If a driver won't be available on a certain date, they can update their status and their passengers will be allocated to a diô€†¯erent driver.

**Minibus Ride Posting:** Allow minibus drivers to post their daily trips to specific locations (e.g., schools, workplaces). Based on the route, allocate passengers who fall within a certain range.

**Dynamic Passenger Allocation:** If needed, the system can reallocate passengers to a different driver on a given day, maintaining flexibility and ensuring passengers reach their destination.

<ins>### Subscription-Based Discounts:</ins>

Encourage consistent app usage through a subscription model with tiered discounts, promoting loyalty. This rewards consistent users with progressively larger discounts, creating a more robust loyalty incentive and appealing to those who need regular transportation, with the added convenience of not always needing travel cash.

The system will be implemented as follows:

**Weekly subscription:** 5% off ride cost

**Monthly subscription:** 10% off ride cost

**Yearly Subscription:** 12% off ride cost


<ins>### Enhanced Matching Algorithm:

To improve the accuracy of matching pickups and drop-offs, our implementation will be as follows:

**Google Maps** offers a **Distance Matrix API** that calculates travel distance and time between multiple origins and destinations, including various travel modes (driving, walking, cycling, etc.), We will use this API to calculate the driving distance between the driver's route and the passenger's destination, factoring in real-time traffic. By calculating distances between passenger destinations and driver routes, incorporating user-defined radius parameters, and considering factors like traffic conditions, our algorithm will optimize matching efficiency, ensuring that passengers' destinations fall within a specified distance from the driver's route, thereby enhancing user satisfaction and the overall eô€†¯ectiveness of the app.
